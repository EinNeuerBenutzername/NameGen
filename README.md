# NameGen

- Stupid single-word fantasy name generator, just compile and run and it will print its output in "out.txt".
- The compiled binary application should be under the same directory with "data.txt".
- The mechanism is simple: scrambling vowels and consonants to produce new words.
- Most of the results are plain trash, but good stuff sometimes do show up.
- Have fun (if you do want to have a try)!
